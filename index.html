I am currently a PhD Candidate at <span style="color: #e2725b;"><strong>Princeton University</strong></span> in
experimental fluid mechanics. I work with Prof. Marcus Hultmark in the
<span style="color: #3aa6b9;"><strong> Fundamental and Applied Studies in Turbulence (FAST) lab</strong></span
>. My accomplishments include experimentally achieving some of the highest Reynolds number airfoil experiments
(exceeding 10 million) by working with the High Reynolds number Test Facility.

I earned my BS in Aerospace Engineering from the
<span style="color: #f5d76e;"><strong>University of Southern California</strong></span
>, and hold an MA in Mechanical Engineering from
<span style="color: #e2725b;"><strong>Princeton University</strong></span
>. I have previously worked in the aerospace industry supporting projects for
<span style="color: #3a69b9ff;"><strong> Rolls-Royce</strong></span> as well as supporting neurobiology research at
<span style="color: #b93a43ff;"><strong> Harvard University</strong></span
>.
